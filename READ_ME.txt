Introduction
 
Given the prompt of making a program, we had the opportunity of making a story-like game rather than simply a database. 
 
The summary of the program is that you are given 3 rooms in which you have to find the solutions to get out. Once successful of these 3 rooms, you are free to exit the
game. The plot of this game is very simple given the time we had to do this and the amount of work we'd have to put when writing in the features/implementations/etc. 
Regardless of the assignment details, the instructions of the game are clear. The program takes in user input using cin and the keyboard. The user may type in their 
name for example, or an answer to a yes or no decision. All they would have to do is type it and enter! As you are reading this, keep in mind that there could be bugs 
that we have not found yet, so bare with us!

Requirements
 
There aren't many requirements for the accessibility of this program besides the header files which it already includes. But if for some reason, the file does not
contain these files, here is the list. 
 
#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>
#include <string>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <time.h>
using namespace std;
 
Besides those header files, there aren't much requirements besides using a C++ compiler.

Installation
 
The code will already be in a C++ file so just open it in  Visual Design Studio and it should work!
But it could also be used on online compilers for we have used them to make the project itself. There shouldn't be a difference on how it works.
The majority of the gameplay instructions are already listed within the program/code itself so not much explaining has to be done here! (TL;DR: The steps on how to run
the project are already in the code and is shown to you using cout).

Troubleshooting
 
There shouldn't be any troubles with actually running the code but if there is such a problem such as certain statements not being able to work, please check the header
files. The header files are necessary in order to play the game including int main() {}. Without those, the program will definitely not run.

FAQ
 
There aren't many questions to begin with on this program but here are few that might be common. 
 
Q- What happens if I die and go back to the menu?
A- We're sorry but you're going to have to play the entire game again!
 
Q- What should I do if I can't figure out a solution to a room? 
A- None of the rooms are too hard but if you do encounter a problem like that, here is a solution for second and third room. The first room is entirely based between 
you and the computer's random number generator.
In the second room, you must get the sword from the knight in your inventory and when you go to the chest, it will say that you broke the chains that constrict it. When
opening the chest, you will see a chalice with wine. You must drink this to find the key. Once you have the key, the door will be free to open.
In the third room, the answers to the riddles, in order, are MAP, SHADOW, and DARK.
 
Q-How do you go back to the menu/look at the menu options again?
A- Enter 0 and it will show you the menu options.

Creators and Acknowledgment
 
The creators of this program, Emily Molstad and Franchesca Lazaro, would like to thank our teacher, Ms. Goyal (Rashi Goyal), for giving us the opportunity to learn
the potential of C++ code and the fundamentals of it. Though the class was very lecture based, the labs and the assignments all worked up to this final proof of what
we have learned in the class. We thank her for taking her time out of her day to teach us and answer our questions (along with Brandon). Thank you very much!
